# *Task Scheduling App*

## *Description*

This is an app that helps me with scheduling my tasks so as not not forget to do somehthing.

## *Language/ Built with*

Python 3.9

Markdown

Tkinter

## *Requirements*

install tkinter

If you want to make the code into a desktop app;

install auto-py-to-exe or pipisntaller

## *Installation*

Using the Terminal or Command Prompt use pip install;
  
  tkinter

If you want to make the code into a desktop app use auto-py-to-exe

This is gotten by using the command:

- pip install auto-py-to-exe in the commandprompt.

## *How it functions*

The code just ask for an input. The input is then displayed as a task to be done.

On the display you can add tasks.

 It also possible to delete completed tasks.

## *To Do*

Currently it is possible to add and delete tasks.

I would have liked to add a calander in this app. So as it is possible to see when the tasks should be done.

## *Changelog for everyversion*

Nothing much was done to the code, doing research on how the code will look like.

Start with the process

Working with the GUI so that everything is placed in the right places.

## *Problems i encountered*

Didn't encounter so many problems with the coding it was more of the installation problems again.

- Fixed by checking my PATHS

My spelling mistakes made is so that some of the code didn't work since the variables that iwas writing didn't match.

-Got fixed by me reading the code a couples of times while questioning myself
