# *Task Scheduling App*

## *Description*

This is an app that helps me with scheduling my tasks so as not not forget to do somehthing.

## *Language/ Built with*

Python 3.9

Markdown

Tkinter

## *Requirements*

install tkinter

If you want to make the code into a desktop app;

install auto-py-to-exe or pipisntaller

## *Installation*

Using the Terminal or Command Prompt use pip install;
  
  tkinter

If you want to make the code into a desktop app use auto-py-to-exe

This is gotten by using the command:

```bash
    pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

## *How it functions*

The code just ask for an input. The input is then displayed as a task to be done.

On the display you can add tasks.

 It also possible to delete completed tasks.

## *To Do*

Currently it is possible to add and delete tasks.

I would have liked to add a calander in this app. So as it is possible to see when the tasks should be done.

Could be good to make it so that after writting a task it is possible to press enter for it to go directly into the tasklist instead of having to press the add button.

## *Changelog for everyversion*

v_1

Nothing much was done to the code, doing research on how the code will look like.

v_1.2

Begun writing the code, looking at Gui tutorials for tkinter

Nothing had begun here but the prototype was already designed using Adobe Xd

v_2
Start with the process

Working with the GUI so that everything is placed in the right places.

Trying to  put  scrollbar on the tasks location.

Had to install auto-py-to-exe(This one worked)

v_4.1

Completed.

No bugs.

## *Problems i encountered*

Didn't encounter so many problems with the coding it was more of the installation problems again.

- Fixed by checking my PATHS

My spelling mistakes made is so that some of the code didn't work since the variables that iwas writing didn't match.

-Got fixed by me reading the code a couples of times while questioning myself

Had a problem with the tasklist

- it turned out that i was not recognized a part of the whole code. Had to make it into a global. This fixed the problem.

Had problems with buttons in this project.Delete button didnt work

- Fixed by creating a function for it and making sure it writes onto the file then deleting selected file.

- But also looking into Anchor, it is a constant which helped me in writing the function for this since i could easy know the location of what is to be deleted.
